## Qplots and closing thoughts

#### 1. Importing dataset

```{r cars}
df = mtcars
head(df)
```

#### 2. Qplots from ggplot2

Qplots are easy and fast ggplot2 visualizations but typed similarly to R base plot syntax.

```{r plot1, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)

qplot(x = mpg, data = df, geom = "histogram", bins = 5, main = "Histogram from mtcars", xlab = "Miles per Gallon")

qplot(x = mpg, data = df, geom = "density", main = "Density plot from mtcars", xlab = "Miles per Gallon")

qplot(x = mpg, data = df, geom = "boxplot", main = "Boxplot from mtcars", xlab = "Miles per Gallon")

qplot(x = wt, y = mpg, data = df, geom = "point", main = "Scatterplot from mtcars", xlab = "weight", ylab = "Miles per Gallon")

```

Note that the `echo = TRUE` parameter was added to the code chunk for printing of the R code that generated the plot.
